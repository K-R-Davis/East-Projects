Project description

I call my project "The Colorless Court", the image is supposed to convey the colorless appearence of the Harrison High School courtyard area, with it being almost completely being concrete & stone. I hope that this will inspire someone in my class to begin work on making the courtyard a more colorful, inviting place for the students who eat outside.
